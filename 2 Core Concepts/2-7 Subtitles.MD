Welcome to our class. Today we will learn Secrets.

## What is Volumes?
Volume is a shared directory in a pod that can be accessed by multiple containers
- The volume is defined on the pod, and then mounted by multiple containers of a pod to a specific file directory
Volumes life cycle has four steps
  - Attach
  - Mount
  - Unmount
  - Detach

- The life cycle of volume and pod in Kubernetes is the same, but not related to the life cycle of the container
- 

## Which types of Volumes?
- emptyDir
- hostPath
- secret
- configMap
- gitRepo
- glusterfs
- awsElasticBlockStore
- gcePersistentDisk
- azureDisk & azureFile
